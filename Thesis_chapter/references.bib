	abstract = {Phylogenetic methods have broad potential in linguistics beyond tree inference. Here, we show how a phylogenetic approach opens the possibility of gaining historical insights from entirely new kinds of linguistic data--in this instance, statistical phonotactics. We extract phonotactic data from 128 Pama-Nyungan vocabularies and apply tests for phylogenetic signal, quantifying the degree to which the data reflect phylogenetic history. We test three datasets: (1) binary variables recording the presence or absence of biphones (two-segment sequences) in a lexicon (2) frequencies of transitions between segments, and (3) frequencies of transitions between natural sound classes. Australian languages have been characterised as having a high degree of phonotactic homogeneity. Nevertheless, we detect phylogenetic signal in all datasets. Phylogenetic signal is higher in finer-grained frequency data than in binary data, and highest in natural-class-based data. These results demonstrate the viability of employing a new source of readily extractable data in historical and comparative linguistics.},

	abstract = {Comparative biologists are often interested in inferring covariation between multiple biological traits sampled across numerous related taxa. To properly study these relationships, we must control for the shared evolutionary history of the taxa to avoid spurious inference. An additional challenge arises as obtaining a full suite of measurements becomes increasingly difficult with increasing taxa. This generally necessitates data imputation or integration, and existing control techniques typically scale poorly as the number of taxa increases. We propose an inference technique that integrates out missing measurements analytically and scales linearly with the number of taxa by using a post-order traversal algorithm under a multivariate Brownian diffusion ({MBD}) model to characterize trait evolution. We further exploit this technique to extend the {MBD} model to account for sampling error or nonheritable residual variance. We test these methods to examine mammalian life history traits, prokaryotic genomic and phenotypic traits, and {HIV} infection traits. We find computational efficiency increases that top two orders-of-magnitude over current best practices. While we focus on the utility of this algorithm in phylogenetic comparative methods, our approach generalizes to solve long-standing challenges in computing the likelihood for matrix-normal and multivariate normal distributions with missing data at scale.

	abstract = {Big Bayes is the computationally intensive co-application of big data and large, expressive Bayesian models for the analysis of complex phenomena in scientific inference and statistical learning. Standing as an example, Bayesian multidimensional scaling ({MDS}) can help scientists learn viral trajectories through space-time, but its computational burden prevents its wider use. Crucial {MDS} model calculations scale quadratically in the number of observations. We partially mitigate this limitation through massive parallelization using multi-core central processing units, instruction-level vectorization and graphics processing units ({GPUs}). Fitting the {MDS} model using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, {GPUs} can deliver more than 100-fold speedups over serial calculations and thus extend Bayesian {MDS} to a big data setting. To illustrate, we employ Bayesian {MDS} to infer the rate at which different seasonal influenza virus subtypes use worldwide air traffic to spread around the globe. We examine 5392 viral sequences and their associated 14 million pairwise distances arising from the number of commercial airline seats per year between viral sampling locations. To adjust for shared evolutionary history of the viruses, we implement a phylogenetic extension to the {MDS} model and learn that subtype H3N2 spreads most effectively, consistent with its epidemic success relative to other seasonal influenza subtypes. Finally, we provide {MassiveMDS}, an open-source, stand-alone C++ library and rudimentary R package, and discuss program design and high-level implementation with an emphasis on important aspects of computing architecture that become relevant at scale.},
