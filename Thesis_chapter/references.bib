	abstract = {Phylogenetic methods have broad potential in linguistics beyond tree inference. Here, we show how a phylogenetic approach opens the possibility of gaining historical insights from entirely new kinds of linguistic data--in this instance, statistical phonotactics. We extract phonotactic data from 128 Pama-Nyungan vocabularies and apply tests for phylogenetic signal, quantifying the degree to which the data reflect phylogenetic history. We test three datasets: (1) binary variables recording the presence or absence of biphones (two-segment sequences) in a lexicon (2) frequencies of transitions between segments, and (3) frequencies of transitions between natural sound classes. Australian languages have been characterised as having a high degree of phonotactic homogeneity. Nevertheless, we detect phylogenetic signal in all datasets. Phylogenetic signal is higher in finer-grained frequency data than in binary data, and highest in natural-class-based data. These results demonstrate the viability of employing a new source of readily extractable data in historical and comparative linguistics.},

	abstract = {Comparative biologists are often interested in inferring covariation between multiple biological traits sampled across numerous related taxa. To properly study these relationships, we must control for the shared evolutionary history of the taxa to avoid spurious inference. An additional challenge arises as obtaining a full suite of measurements becomes increasingly difficult with increasing taxa. This generally necessitates data imputation or integration, and existing control techniques typically scale poorly as the number of taxa increases. We propose an inference technique that integrates out missing measurements analytically and scales linearly with the number of taxa by using a post-order traversal algorithm under a multivariate Brownian diffusion ({MBD}) model to characterize trait evolution. We further exploit this technique to extend the {MBD} model to account for sampling error or nonheritable residual variance. We test these methods to examine mammalian life history traits, prokaryotic genomic and phenotypic traits, and {HIV} infection traits. We find computational efficiency increases that top two orders-of-magnitude over current best practices. While we focus on the utility of this algorithm in phylogenetic comparative methods, our approach generalizes to solve long-standing challenges in computing the likelihood for matrix-normal and multivariate normal distributions with missing data at scale.

	abstract = {Big Bayes is the computationally intensive co-application of big data and large, expressive Bayesian models for the analysis of complex phenomena in scientific inference and statistical learning. Standing as an example, Bayesian multidimensional scaling ({MDS}) can help scientists learn viral trajectories through space-time, but its computational burden prevents its wider use. Crucial {MDS} model calculations scale quadratically in the number of observations. We partially mitigate this limitation through massive parallelization using multi-core central processing units, instruction-level vectorization and graphics processing units ({GPUs}). Fitting the {MDS} model using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, {GPUs} can deliver more than 100-fold speedups over serial calculations and thus extend Bayesian {MDS} to a big data setting. To illustrate, we employ Bayesian {MDS} to infer the rate at which different seasonal influenza virus subtypes use worldwide air traffic to spread around the globe. We examine 5392 viral sequences and their associated 14 million pairwise distances arising from the number of commercial airline seats per year between viral sampling locations. To adjust for shared evolutionary history of the viruses, we implement a phylogenetic extension to the {MDS} model and learn that subtype H3N2 spreads most effectively, consistent with its epidemic success relative to other seasonal influenza subtypes.

	abstract = {Recent studies have detailed a remarkable degree of genetic and linguistic diversity in Northern Island Melanesia. Here we utilize that diversity to examine two models of genetic and linguistic coevolution. The first model predicts that genetic and linguistic correspondences formed following population splits and isolation at the time of early range expansions into the region. The second is analogous to the genetic model of isolation by distance, and it predicts that genetic and linguistic correspondences formed through continuing genetic and linguistic exchange between neighboring populations. We tested the predictions of the two models by comparing observed and simulated patterns of genetic variation, genetic and linguistic trees, and matrices of genetic, linguistic, and geographic distances. The data consist of 751 autosomal microsatellites and 108 structural linguistic features collected from 33 Northern Island Melanesian populations. The results of the tests indicate that linguistic and genetic exchange have erased any evidence of a splitting and isolation process that might have occurred early in the settlement history of the region. The correlation patterns are also inconsistent with the predictions of the isolation by distance coevolutionary process in the larger Northern Island Melanesian region, but there is strong evidence for the process in the rugged interior of the largest island in the region (New Britain). There we found some of the strongest recorded correlations between genetic, linguistic, and geographic distances. We also found that, throughout the region, linguistic features have generally been less likely to diffuse across population boundaries than genes. The results from our study, based on exceptionally fine-grained data, show that local genetic and linguistic exchange are likely to obscure evidence of the early history of a region, and that language barriers do not particularly hinder genetic exchange. In contrast, global patterns may emphasize more ancient demographic events, including population splits associated with the early colonization of major world regions.},

Applications to date, however, have been hampered by traditional approaches dependent on unfalsifiable authority statements: in this regard, historical linguistics remains in a similar position to evolutionary biology prior to the cladistic revolution. Influential phylogenetic studies of Bantu languages over the last two decades, which provide the foundation for multiple analyses of Bantu sociocultural histories, are a major case in point. Comparative analyses of basic lexica, instead of directly treating written words, use only numerical symbols that express non-replicable authority opinion about underlying relationships. Building on a previous study of Uto-Aztecan, here we analyse Bantu language relationships with methods deriving from {DNA} sequence optimization algorithms, treating basic vocabulary as sequences of sounds. This yields finer-grained results that indicate major revisions to the Bantu tree, and enables more robust inferences about the history of Bantu language expansion and/or migration throughout sub-Saharan Africa. “Early-split” versus “late-split” hypotheses for East and West Bantu are tested, and overall results are compared to trees based on numerical reductions of vocabulary data. Reconstruction of language histories is more empirically based and robust than with previous methods.},

Neither the geographical origin of the Dravidian language homeland nor its exact dispersal through time are known. The history of these languages is crucial for understanding prehistory in Eurasia, because despite their current restricted range, these languages played a significant role in influencing other language groups including Indo-Aryan (Indo-European) and Munda (Austroasiatic) speakers. Here, we report the results of a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of cognate-coded lexical data, elicited first hand from native speakers, to investigate the subgrouping of the Dravidian language family, and provide dates for the major points of diversification. Our results indicate that the Dravidian language family is approximately 4500 years old, a finding that corresponds well with earlier linguistic and archaeological studies. The main branches of the Dravidian language family (North, Central, South I, South {II}) are recovered, although the placement of languages within these main branches diverges from previous classifications. We find considerable uncertainty with regard to the relationships between the main branches.},

An alternative hypothesis claims that the languages spread from Anatolia with the expansion of farming 8000 to 9500 years ago. We used Bayesian phylogeographic approaches, together with basic vocabulary data from 103 ancient and contemporary Indo-European languages, to explicitly model the expansion of the family and test these hypotheses. We found decisive support for an Anatolian origin over a steppe origin. Both the inferred timing and root location of the Indo-European language trees fit with an agricultural expansion from Anatolia beginning 8000 to 9500 years ago. These results highlight the critical role that phylogeographic inference can play in resolving debates about human prehistory.

We used lexical data and Bayesian phylogenetic methods to construct a phylogeny of 400 languages. In agreement with the pulse-pause scenario, the language trees place the Austronesian origin in Taiwan approximately 5230 years ago and reveal a series of settlement pauses and expansion pulses linked to technological and social innovations. These results are robust to assumptions about the rooting and calibration of the trees and demonstrate the combined power of linguistic scholarship, database technologies, and computational phylogenetic methods for resolving questions about human prehistory.

The origin of the Indo-European language family is “the most intensively studied, yet still most recalcitrant, problem of historical linguistics”3.

We test two theories of Indo-European origin: the ‘Kurgan expansion’ and the ‘Anatolian farming’ hypotheses. The Kurgan theory centres on possible archaeological evidence for an expansion into Europe and the Near East by Kurgan horsemen beginning in the sixth millennium {BP}7,8. In contrast, the Anatolian theory claims that Indo-European languages expanded with the spread of agriculture from Anatolia around 8,000–9,500 years bp9. In striking agreement with the Anatolian hypothesis, our analysis of a matrix of 87 languages with 2,449 lexical items produced an estimated age range for the initial Indo-European divergence of between 7,800 and 9,800 years bp. These results were robust to changes in coding procedures, calibration points, rooting of the trees and priors in the bayesian analysis.},

While the database was initially developed in order to facilitate research on cognate words and reconstructions, it has had many uses beyond its original purpose, in synchronic theoretical linguistics, language documentation, and language reclamation. Creating a multi-audience database of this type has been challenging, however. Some of the challenges stemmed from success: as the size of the database grew, the original data structure became unwieldy. Other challenges grew from the difficulties in anticipating future needs, in keeping track of materials, and in coping with diverse input formats for so many highly endangered languages.  
 
In this paper I document the structure of the database, provide an overview of its uses (both in diachronic and synchronic research), and discuss some of the issues that have arisen during the project and choices that needed to be made as the database was created, compiled, curated, and shared. I address here the major problems that arise with linguistic data, particularly databases created for diverse audiences, from diverse data, with little infrastructure support.},

This paper presents an internal classification of these languages by combining both the traditional comparative method ({CM}) and Bayesian phylogenetic inference ({BPI}). We identify multiple systematic sound correspondences and 285 cognate sets of basic vocabulary using the available documentation. These allow us to reconstruct a large portion of the Proto-Chapacuran phonemic inventory and identify tentative major subgroupings. The cognate sets form the input for the {BPI} analysis, which uses a stochastic Continuous-Time Markov Chain to model the change of these cognate sets over time. We test various models of lexical substitution and evolutionary clocks, and use ethnohistorical information and data collection dates to calibrate the resulting trees. The {CM} and {BPI} analyses produce largely congruent results, suggesting a division of the family into three different clades.},

	abstract = {The population history of Aboriginal Australians remains largely uncharacterized. Here we generate high-coverage genomes for 83 Aboriginal Australians (speakers of Pama-Nyungan languages) and 25 Papuans from the New Guinea Highlands. We find that Papuan and Aboriginal Australian ancestors diversified 25-40 thousand years ago (kya), suggesting pre-Holocene population structure in the ancient continent of Sahul (Australia, New Guinea and Tasmania). However, all of the studied Aboriginal Australians descend from a single founding population that differentiated {\textasciitilde}10-32 kya. We infer a population expansion in northeast Australia during the Holocene epoch (past 10,000 years) associated with limited gene flow from this region to the rest of Australia, consistent with the spread of the Pama-Nyungan languages. We estimate that Aboriginal Australians and Papuans diverged from Eurasians 51-72 kya, following a single out-of-Africa dispersal, and subsequently admixed with archaic populations. Finally, we report evidence of selection in Aboriginal Australians potentially associated with living in the desert.},

Instead of using existing vocabulary-based methods, which cannot be applied to these languages due to the paucity of shared lexemes, we created a database of {STRUCTURAL} {FEATURES}--abstract phonological and grammatical features apart from their form. The methods are first tested on the closely related Oceanic languages spoken in the same region as the Papuan languages in question. We find that using biological methods on structural features can recapitulate the results of the comparative method tree for the Oceanic languages, thus showing that structural features can be a valid way of extracting linguistic history. Application of the same methods to the otherwise unrelatable Papuan languages is therefore likely to be similarly valid. Because languages that have been in contact for protracted periods may also converge, we outline additional methods for distinguishing convergence from inherited relatedness.},

Linguistic  datasets  contain  uncertainties,  just  as  data  do  in  any  field.  This  matters,  because foundational work in phylogenetics showed that results can be improved when data uncertainty is made explicitly available during mathematical calculations. Here we confirm that this is true also  for  linguistic  data;  language  is  not  an  exception  to  phylogenetics’  mathematical  found-ations. For linguisticsourcontributionis timely, becauseit clarifies howwe canmost effectively engage withdata uncertaintywhen using phylogenetic techniques, with implications for both dataset compilation and analysis.Crucially, the keyquestionis not ‘how big must the datasetbe, e.g. how many tokens of X?’, but rather ‘what quantity of uncertainty exists in the measure which this dataset provides for us, and how do we incorporate that intothe model?’Theoretical {backgroundModern} phylogenetic techniques are statistical, which is to say,they fundamentally deal withvariation and uncertainty. As Felsenstein (1985) articulates, if a process is affecting some variable as it evolves along a tree, and it does so in a statistically evenhanded way —evolution in one direction or the other is equally likely —then (a) the averageeffecton any  one  lineage  is  zero,  but  also  (b)  the average  divergencebetween  two  lineages  grows  with time. It  is  thisgrowth  in  variance that can  be  studied  to  infer  the  distancesin  timebetween points on a tree, and thus to infer the shape of the tree,or to compare a variable’s evolution to a reference tree, inter alia. Turning to datasets, uncertainty in the measured value of a variable is also a kind of variance. If such variance exists but the statistical model ignores it, the variance due tomeasurement can get incorrectly attributedto or comparedwiththe treeitself, degrading the  results. Happily,  the  converse  is  true.It  is  possible  for phylogenetic  techniquesto  take quantified measurement uncertaintyinto account, thereby improvingtheir performance.Linguistic {demonstrationLinguistic} implications of thismay be clearest in quantitative data-sets, where some amount of data, e.g. some number of tokens, is collected and summarized (e.g. averaged) in order to characterize each language. Since the data in such cases is a sample andnot an exhaustive inventory of all possibilities, thecharacterization that it providesof the actual, real language facts comes with some uncertainty.To illustrate the connection between measure-ment uncertainty in linguistic data and phylogenetic computation, we compiled a dataset of the frequency  of  biphones  (i.e., two-phoneme sequences)  in 128Pama-Nyungan  languages,  and compared themto trees inferredindependently using cognacydata. Since biphone frequency is a  property  of the vocabulary,  which over timeis inherited  with  modification,  we  expect  its variance  to  largely  matchthe  reference  tree.The  degree  to  which  they do match,  known  as {PHYLOGENETIC} {SIGNAL}, isassessed bywell-understood techniquessuch as Blomberg’s Kstatistic.For  each  biphone  variable,  we  estimated the  variable’smeasurement  uncertainty  as binomial standard  error,  a  common  metric  of  uncertainty  in  frequency  data.  As  predicted,  a  negative correlationexistsbetween  measurement  uncertainty  and  phylogenetic  signal  (figure  1).  One intuitive  response  might  be:  we  must  use  only  the  least  uncertain  data. However,  the  mathe-matics says: we mustquantify uncertainty and use that in the model. Using a variant of the Kstatistic that incorporates quantifiedmeasurementuncertainty, we used all variables and found a furtherincrease in inferred phylogenetic signal(figure 2), caused by the fact thatthe statisticwasno longer mistakingvariance in ourmeasurementsasvariance due to history.Implications \&conclusions   Mathematicians who build phylogenetic techniques are aware of howmeasurement errorcan affect results, and so many techniques are builtspecificallyto take it  into  account.  Linguistsperforming  phylogenetic  inference  can  improve  their  results  by quantifying uncertaintyandwherever possible,incorporating it into the analysis.},
