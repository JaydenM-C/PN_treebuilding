# INPUT:
#    - A directory called Bouckaert_etal, containing files Pny10-Export.tsv and pny10.pl
#    - A directory called Data_prep, containing file prepare_pn_phonotactic_traits.R
# OUTPUT:
#    - A directory called Data, containing pny10_cognates_[date].nex, biphone_traits_[date].tsv and soundclass_traits_[date].tsv
#    - In Data_prep, the file pny10_filtered_[date].pl and Pny10-Export_filtered_[date].tsv
# REQUIREMENTS:
#    - Software: bash, R (with packages: Ausphonlex, tidyverse), Perl
#    - NB: Script has been run on hardware/software as described below.
#          No specific versioning requirements are known, but script has not been tested on alternative setups so success is not guaranteed.
#    - Unfortunately, on line 71 of the R script, there is a hard-coded filepath to a data file in the Ausphonlex package, Ausphonlex/dbs/Maps-DB-wordlists.csv.
#      Currently, this R script will only work if that filepath is accurate.
# USAGE:
#    - Make sure this executable file is saved in your terminal's $PATH variable (check 'echo $PATH')
#    - If not, either move file to somewhere in the $PATH (e.g. usr/bin) or add its location to the PATH.
#    - Make sure input directories are saved in the current working directory
#    - Run command prepare_pn_data

# SOURCES

# Pama-Nyungan cognate data is sourced from the Zenodo record for the following reference:

#   Bouckaert, Remco, Bowern, Claire, & Atkinson, Quentin. (2018). 
#   The origin and expansion of Pamaâ€“Nyungan languages across Australia: Cognate Data (Version 1.) [Data set].

#   Zenodo record: https://zenodo.org/record/1320471 (Accessed, downloaded 2019-07-08)
#
# The Zenodo record contains a spreadsheet of original cognate data and a Perl script for converting the data to Nexus format.
# The Perl script was created for Bouckaert et al.'s in-house research purposes and requires a little intervention to insert the cognate data into the script successfully.
# Original Zenodo downloads are preserved, untouched, in Bouckaert_etal directory.
